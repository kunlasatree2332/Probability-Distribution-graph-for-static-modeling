# Probability-Distribution-graph-for-static-modeling
Static modeling is the process of building a 3D reservoir model. In contrast, probabilistic static modeling takes uncertainty into account and creates many realizations of the model to generate distributions of key properties, such as GIIP, OOIP, net-to-gross, porosity, and permeability, which are usually reported as P10, P50, and P90 values.
When we calculate volumetrics using a probabilistic approach, we obtain many possible volume values. By plotting these results on a probability distribution graph, we can identify representative values for each probability level, such as P10, P50, and P90.
